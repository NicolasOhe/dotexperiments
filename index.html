        These experiments are built on top of each other. There is a progression
        in the underlying code.

            <h3>Version 1 - Spider net</h3>
            <p>
              Dots are connected to neighboors by grey lines. The shades of grey
              depend on their distance. Distant connections slow down the
              deplacement of the dots, close connections increase their
              velocity.

          <img src="v2/image.png" alt="skyline" />
          <h3>Version 2 - Skyline</h3>
          <p>Same as version one with fewer dots.</p>

        <section>
          <img src="v3/image.png" alt="zodiac signs" />
          <h3>Version 3 - Zodiac signs</h3>
          <p>Dots connect to a limited number of neighboors. Their speed is constant.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <img src="v4/image.png" alt="elective affinities" />
          <h3>Version 4 -  Elective affinities</h3>
          <p>Dots have a limited number of possible connections. The number of connections is represented as a color.</p>

        <section>
          <img src="v5/image.png" alt="Labyrinth" />
          <h3>Version 5 - Labyrinth</h3>
          <p>Dots interact again depending on how close the dots to which they connected is. The resulting labyrinthic pattern can be observed with a click, which pauses the animation.</p>

        <section>
          <img src="v6/image.png" alt="Crystallization" />
          <h3>Version 6 - Crystallization</h3>
          <p>Dots connect with neighboors to build triangles. The process is slown down to see the progression.</p>

      <a href="v7/index.html">
        <section>
          <img src="v7/image.png" alt="Dead angles" />
          <h3>Version 7 - Dead angles</h3>
          <p>To avoid triangles to overlap, dead angles for each dot are tracked. It didn't work as expected as besides the angle, the direction (clockwise or anticlockwise) should be registred. Furthermore, the dead angles are generally too restrictive.</p>

        <section>
          <img src="v8/image.png" alt="Sparkling blob" />
          <h3>Version 8 - Sparkling blob</h3>
          <p>Dots connect and build triangles without overlaping. They move and interact: short distance is repulsive, distance attracts.</p>

      <a href="v9/index.html">
        <section>
          <img src="v9/image.png" alt="" />
          <h3>Version 9 - Color shards</h3>
          <p>Background image added to mask potential holes in the pattern. Triangles appear and disappear slowly. Options can be live changed in the console (type "options" to see the props).</p>
